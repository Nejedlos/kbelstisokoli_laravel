They are a testimony to the immense amount of free time, personal sacrifice and enthusiasm that our officials and especially coaches have devoted to Kbely basketball over the past fifty years. In this unflagging activity, we see a guarantee of the success of Kbely basketball for the future. Almost a thousand students have passed through sports training in our club, to whom our enthusiasts have dedicated themselves selflessly. Our goal has always been not only sports education, but also education for fair play in sports and in life. To all those who have participated and are participating in Kbely basketball, we owe our deep admiration and thanks.',
